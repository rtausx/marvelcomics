It's a final chance at redemption and a second life - and an opportunity to prove, once and for all, that they're worthy of the name Avengers. Plus: Ares defeated Chaos King once before, but now the God of War is dead and armed only with his love for his lost son. How can he stop the living oblivion Chaos King has become, even with the help of Zeus and Hera? And at what price comes defeat? And in the midst of the epic battle raging through CHAOS WAR, Thor squares off against a foe who may be the most powerful he's ever faced: the alien god known only as Glory! This powerhouse has his sites set on helping Chaos King destroy all reality, so what hope does a simple Thunder God have of stopping him?*,*http://marvel.com/comics/collection/37633/chaos_war_avengers_tpb_trade_paperback?utm_campaign=apiRef&utm_source=818dad62b16c153f47f723d32982e787*,*http://i.annihil.us/u/prod/marvel/i/mg/b/f0/4d35acc3c608c.jpg*,*2011*

Next, Venom is back in town, and he's on a rampage...but it has nothing to do with his vendetta against Spidey? What could be so important that Venom doesn't have the time to torture his nemesis? Peter Parker is determined to find out, but first he'll have to match journalistic wits with none other than Eddie Brock!

Well, ANYway…we’re taking you back in time, when Spidey was pretty new at all this super hero stuff, and would make silly mistakes, like, oh, say...knocking out the Invisible Girl!

In his father's eyes, Harry Osborn was never good enough. Harry's pal, Peter Parker, was truly the type of son Norman Osborn wanted - studious, inventive, strong-willed and industrious. In contrast, Harry had always wilted under life's pressures and the strain of his father's domineering influence, unable to live up to Norman's expectations. Unfortunately, Harry remained unaware of his father's dark side as the Green Goblin until it was too late. Witnessing Norman's apparent death in battle with Spider-Man, Harry was driven to the brink of insanity. Assuming his late father's identity, he began a descent into madness that would haunt him his entire life; only in death could he finally find peace.
